# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Neural Networks

## Project Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for predicting stock prices of ASIANPAINT.NS. The model is designed to forecast hourly closing prices in an autoregressive manner, making it suitable for real-time trading applications.

*Project completed as part of Deep Learning coursework*

## Problem Statement

### Objective
Develop an LSTM-based model to predict the hourly closing price of ASIANPAINT.NS stock for the next 5 trading days (125 predictions: 5 days × 25 hourly intervals from 9:15 AM to 3:15 PM IST).

### Challenges
- **Variable sequence length**: The model must handle input sequences of any length
- **Market dynamics**: Stock prices exhibit non-linear patterns, volatility clustering, and regime changes
- **Feature engineering**: Incorporating technical indicators to capture market sentiment
- **Temporal dependencies**: Capturing both short-term and long-term market trends

### Evaluation Metrics
The model performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) with the following grading criteria:
- MSE < 20: Excellent (4 points)
- 20 ≤ MSE < 100: Good (3 points)
- 100 ≤ MSE < 1000: Fair (2 points)
- 1000 ≤ MSE < 5000: Poor (1 point)
- MSE ≥ 5000: Fail (0 points)

## Methodology

### 1. Architecture Design

The LSTM model architecture consists of:

```
Input Layer → LSTM Layers → Dense Layer → ReLU → Dropout → Output Layer
```

**Mathematical Formulation:**

The LSTM cell operations are defined as:

```
f_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)     # Forget gate
i_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)     # Input gate  
C̃_t = tanh(W_C · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)  # Candidate values
C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * C̃_t         # Cell state
o_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)     # Output gate
h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)                   # Hidden state
```

Where:
- σ is the sigmoid function
- W and b are weight matrices and bias vectors
- * denotes element-wise multiplication

### 2. Feature Engineering

The model incorporates multiple technical indicators:

**Price Features:**
- Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

**Technical Indicators:**
- **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**
  ```
  SMA_n = (1/n) Σ(i=t-n+1 to t) Price_i
  ```

- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):**
  ```
  RS = Average Gain / Average Loss
  RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
  ```

### 3. Data Preprocessing Pipeline

**Normalization:**
All features are normalized using Min-Max scaling:

```
X_norm = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)
```

**Sequence Generation:**
For autoregressive prediction, sequences are created with sliding windows where each sequence predicts the next time step.

### 4. Model Implementation

#### Forward Pass
```python
def forward(self, x):
    batch_size, seq_len = x.size(0), x.size(1)
    
    # Handle variable input dimensions
    if x.size(-1) != self.input_dim:
        if x.size(-1) == 1:
            x = x.repeat(1, 1, self.input_dim)
    
    # Initialize hidden and cell states
    h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_dim).to(x.device)
    c0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_dim).to(x.device)
    
    # LSTM forward pass
    lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))
    
    # Output layers with regularization
    out = self.fc(lstm_out[:, -1, :])
    out = self.relu(out)
    out = self.dropout(out)
    out = self.output_layer(out)
    
    return out
```

#### Loss Function
The model uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss:

```
MSE = (1/n) Σ(i=1 to n) (y_i - ŷ_i)²
```

Where:
- y_i is the actual price
- ŷ_i is the predicted price
- n is the number of predictions

3. **Convergence (Epochs 51-82)**: Stable performance with minimal fluctuations

## Technical Innovations

### 1. Adaptive Input Handling
The model dynamically adjusts to variable input dimensions, making it robust for different data formats:

```python
if x.size(-1) != self.input_dim:
    if x.size(-1) == 1:
        x = x.repeat(1, 1, self.input_dim)
```

### 2. Robust Preprocessing Pipeline
- Handles missing market data during holidays
- Implements technical indicators with adaptive window sizes
- Provides both simple (close-only) and complex (multi-feature) preprocessing modes

### 3. Intelligent Postprocessing
The inverse scaling operation correctly handles both single-feature and multi-feature scenarios:

```python
if hasattr(self, 'close_idx'):
    dummy = np.zeros((len(data), len(self.feature_min)))
    dummy[:, self.close_idx] = data.flatten()
    inversed = (dummy * self.feature_range) + self.feature_min
    return inversed[:, self.close_idx]
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Attention Mechanisms**: Incorporate attention layers for better long-term dependencies
2. **Multi-Asset Prediction**: Extend to predict multiple stock prices simultaneously
3. **Real-time Integration**: API integration for live trading applications
